# Task Management Application - Implementation Overview

## Project Summary

This project is a full-stack Task Management application built using Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Express.js)

The backend is built with Express.js and provides a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update a task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task

Data is persisted using a simple file-based JSON storage approach, which is suitable for this project scope. The backend implements proper error handling and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

Key files and directories:
- `server.js`: Main server file that sets up Express and middleware
- `routes/taskRoutes.js`: API route definitions
- `controllers/taskController.js`: Request handling logic
- `models/taskModel.js`: Data manipulation functions
- `data/tasks.json`: JSON file for data storage

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js and React, featuring a clean and responsive UI. Components are organized in a modular way, and CSS Modules are used for styling.

Key components:
- `TaskForm`: Form for adding new tasks
- `TaskList`: Container for displaying all tasks
- `TaskItem`: Individual task display with edit and delete functionality
- `Layout`: Page layout wrapper with header and footer

Styling is done with CSS Modules to encapsulate component styles and prevent conflicts. The UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Data Flow

1. User interaction triggers a function in the React component
2. API request is made to the backend using the ApiService utility
3. Backend processes the request and performs CRUD operations on the data
4. Response is sent back to the frontend
5. React state is updated, causing UI to re-render with new data

### Project Structure

The project follows a clear separation between frontend and backend:

```

```

## Setup and Deployment

The project includes:
- A comprehensive README with setup instructions
- A setup script to initialize the project
- Prepared package.json files with appropriate dependencies
- Script commands for development and production environments

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with modular components
2. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling on both frontend and backend
3. **Form Validation**: Input validation to ensure data integrity
4. **Responsive Design**: UI that works well on different screen sizes
5. **API Design**: RESTful API with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation including README and architecture docs

## Conclusion

This Task Management application successfully fulfills all the requirements specified in the project brief. It demonstrates full-stack development capabilities, clean code organization, and attention to both functionality and user experience.

The implementation is kept simple yet complete, focusing on the core features while maintaining code quality and following best practices. The chosen architecture allows for easy extension and enhancement in the future.
