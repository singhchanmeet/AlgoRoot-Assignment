# Task Management Application - Architecture Document

## Overview

The Task Management Application is a full-stack web application built with Next.js (frontend) and Express.js (backend). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Handles the user interface and interaction
   - Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls
   - Manages local state for UI rendering and updates

2. **Backend (Express.js)**
   - Provides RESTful API endpoints
   - Implements business logic
   - Manages data persistence using file-based storage

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with the UI (add/edit/delete/complete task)
2. Frontend makes API requests to the backend
3. Backend processes the request and performs CRUD operations on the data
4. Backend returns the response to the frontend
5. Frontend updates the UI based on the response

## Design Decisions

### Frontend

1. **Next.js Framework**
   - Provides server-side rendering capabilities for better performance and SEO
   - Simplifies routing and state management
   - Offers built-in API routes (though we're using a separate Express backend)

2. **Component Structure**
   - Modular design with reusable components
   - Separation of concerns between presentation and logic
   - Components:
     - `Layout`: Overall page structure
     - `TaskForm`: Form for adding new tasks
     - `TaskList`: Container for task items
     - `TaskItem`: Individual task display with edit/delete capabilities

3. **State Management**
   - React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management
   - API service for data fetching and modification
   - Props for passing data between components

4. **Styling**
   - CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Consistent color scheme and UI elements

### Backend

1. **Express.js Framework**
   - Lightweight and flexible Node.js web framework
   - Easy to set up and configure
   - Robust middleware ecosystem

2. **API Design**
   - RESTful architecture
   - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Appropriate status codes and error handling
   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

3. **Data Persistence**
   - File-based JSON storage for simplicity
   - UUID for generating unique identifiers
   - Structured data model with validation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error messages for debugging

## Data Model

The task model consists of the following fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier (string, UUID format)
- `title`: Brief description of the task (string, required)
- `description`: Detailed information about the task (string, optional)
- `completed`: Task completion status (boolean)
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the task was created (ISO date string)
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp when the task was last updated (ISO date string)

## Security Considerations

While this is a basic implementation, some security aspects to consider:

1. Input validation on both frontend and backend
2. CORS configuration to restrict allowed origins
3. Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Performance Considerations

1. Optimized React rendering with proper key usage
2. Efficient data loading and state updates
3. Simple file-based storage suitable for small to medium datasets

## Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - User accounts and login functionality
   - Role-based access control

2. **Advanced Task Features**
   - Categories/tags for tasks
   - Due dates and reminders
   - Priority levels
   - File attachments

3. **Database Integration**
   - Replace file-based storage with a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Implement data validation and schemas

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for task reordering
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Animations and transitions
   - Advanced filtering and sorting options

5. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Service worker for offline access
   - Local storage for offline data persistence
